# Return 0 if $1 is a tty and open it. Otherwise return
# 0. _Dbg_new_fdi will be set to the file descriptor of the open tty
# or set to -1 if none could be opened.

# We write the interface this way because intead of say a routine to
# test a name refers to a terminal, because it's easy to tell if a
# file descriptor is a tty but not so easy using just the name. And we
# want to avoid opening and closing file descriptors unnecessarily.
