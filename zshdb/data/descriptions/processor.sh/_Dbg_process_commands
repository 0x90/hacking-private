# The main debugger command reading loop.

# Note: We have to be careful here in naming "local" variables. In contrast
# to other places in the debugger, because of the read/eval loop, they are
# in fact seen by those using the debugger. So in contrast to other "local"s
# in the debugger, we prefer to preface these with _Dbg_.
