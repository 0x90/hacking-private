# Iconography

### Devoted time or work detection

ü•à - has 50 or more commits  
ü•á - has 100 or more commits

### Progress detection

üö∂- slow/moderate progress: 1 commit in each of last 3 months or 5 commits in total in 3 last months  
üèÉ- fast progress: 3 commits in each of last 3 months or 10 commits in total in last 3 months

### Attention detection

‚åõÔ∏è- long time no update (updated not in last 3 months, but in last 6 months)  
‚è≥ - updated in last 3 months, active  
‚è∞ - updated in last month and month before it (single new commit will not yield such a strong symbol like alarm clock; the additional criterion ("month before it") is to take into account only more constantly attended projects),

### Research & development detection

üíº - has branches with at least 50 commits in total  
üìà ‚Äì the branches were active 3 times in last 4 months
